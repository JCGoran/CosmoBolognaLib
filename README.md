# CosmoBolognaLib

The CosmoBolognaLib is a large set of Open Source C++ libraries for cosmological calculations. Among many other things, these libraries can be used to measure the two-point and three-point correlation functions, and to model redshift-space distortions and baryon acoustic oscillations.

Please have a look at the example codes in CosmoBolognaLib/Examples/ that show how to use the CosmoBolognaLib in either C++ or Python codes.
